# ideas

# tasks
dw, i finally pressed done on these tasks!
 - [ ] add complete list of words, in a popup
 - hun & eng version of the site?
``` it's kind of mixed at the moment, so idk ```
 - score system?
``` an correct/incorrect answer percentage at the bottom should be fine. altough when starting the quiz again there should be an indicator ```
 - [x] switching back to normal information text after guess is broken, idk why

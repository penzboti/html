# tasks
dw, i finally pressed done on these tasks!
 - [x] add button toggling with all arrow keys (just an event listenner)
 - [ ] make an index.html in root folder, so github pages loads sg. Then can we open any html file from the main one? Hopefully! Free, best github integration website hosting "service".
 - [ ] add complete list of words
```
pictures, or just go trough the word list and create elements on a popup maybe?
```
 - hun & eng version of the site?
```
it's kind of mixed at the moment, so idk
```
 - score system?
```
probably would just be a right/failed percentage at the bottom.

# ideas
 - Deutsche-multido to do regular german word practice aswell
 - copy Qlocktwo's clock desing
 - copy keybr.com's keyboard desing

# tasks
## deutsche-multido
 - [ ] add complete list of words, in a popup
 - hun & eng version of the site?
``` it's kind of mixed at the moment, so idk ```
 - score system?
``` an correct/incorrect answer percentage at the bottom should be fine. altough when starting the quiz again there should be an indicator ```

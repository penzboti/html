## deutsche-multido
 - [ ] add complete list of words, in a popup
 - hun & eng version of the site?
```it's kind of mixed at the moment, so idk ```
 - score system?
```a correct/incorrect answer percentage at the bottom should be fine. altough when starting the quiz again there should be an indicator ```
## clock
 - [x] ~~hungarian~~ german version, toggleable
```there is no existing hungarian version, and i couldnt really make it doable so im just skipping over it```
## wordle solver
 - [ ] there is a bug. ```if you input a word with 1-2 same letters, it will screw up the system. working on a fix```

# ideas
 - copy Qlocktwo's clock desing

# tasks
## deutsche-multido
 - [ ] add complete list of words, in a popup
 - hun & eng version of the site?
```it's kind of mixed at the moment, so idk ```
 - score system?
```a correct/incorrect answer percentage at the bottom should be fine. altough when starting the quiz again there should be an indicator ```
## keyboard remake
 - [ ] full keyboard support, special characters ```in the works```
```the ability to type them aswell as able to view them on the keyboard when the special key is pressed (like shift or ctrl)```
```this probably means more javascript instead of html, probably will have to decide between e.key || e.code```
 - [ ] some apple macbook bug, probably NOT with keycode
 - [ ] the ability to touch buttons so i can show it off on mobile aswell
 - [ ] some small extras, activatable by codes

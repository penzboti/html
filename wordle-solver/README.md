# info
Aids you in solving the wordle puzzle.
You choose a word, you put it in, then you input the feedback you got from the game.
By the way, you may enter any word you like, there is no check for validity.

## normal mode
You can choose a word from all the possible words.

## assisted mode
The assisted mode scores the words, and gives the best ones for you to use.
If more than 3 letters are green, it helps you eliminate more letters with special words.

## anwers mode
Normally, the machine uses all of the valid words that wordle uses.
I felt like only being able to use winning words felt odd.
But this toggle makes it so that there is a smaller word list to choose from, both for you and the assisted mode computer.

## hungarian language
One of my friend made a private version of the wordle game in the hungarian language.
I've decided to include it here, both to help my friends in that game,
and as a thank you for the idea of this project.

# info
aids you in solving the wordle puzzle.
you choose a word, you put it in, then you input the feedback you got from the game.
then you can choose a possible word on the list, and repeat.

this is currently just helps you reduce the word list. it still relies on you.
an assisted mode is in the works

# done already
percentage calculating:
count all the letters individually in all the words
give every word a score
suggests you the words with the most score
do this on every move

# todo
 - [x] right click to instantly green a letter
 - [x] fix undefined in assisted mode
 - [x] change style of unselectable items in *words*
 - [x] fix undefined in assisted mode if no words remain
 - [x] fix hover on non usable text in words list
 - [x] some js code explaining

# wild idea
do the percentage calculation but divide the letters into columns
dont know how one would do it yet
